Objective
The main objective of the game is to collect all 5 collectibles and get as much points as possible from the coins while staying alive and avoid dying from the hazards.
Collect 2 collectibles from the spawn -> Unlock the locked door that only will unlock once the 2 collectible are unlocked-> Collect as much points as possible from the maze and find the door to the hazards -> Survive all 3 hazards and collect another 2 collectibles -> Finish the parkour and collect the last collectible and go to the win portal -> Congrats screen with the point system

Game Hack
There is sadly no game hack as the player must collect all 5 collectible for the portal being able to open.

Platform/hardware/desired settings required to run the application
-	Windows PC and the platform should be Windows 10/11
-	 CPU should be Intel Core i3 or AMD equivalent.
-	RAM should be 4GB 
-	GPU should be integrated graphics or Intel HD Graphics 4000 or better
-	Storage should have at least 500 MB of free disk space.

Limitation/bugs
Sometimes players are stuck at the edge of the parkour which is not supposed to happen. Additionally, sometimes the walls of my 3d virtual playground does not show up but it is a small bug as players will not be able to pass through the wall.
